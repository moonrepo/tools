# Node.js plugin

Node.js WASM plugin for [proto](https://github.com/moonrepo/proto).

## Installation

```shell
proto install node
```

This plugin is built-in to proto, but if you want to override it with an explicit version, add the following to `.prototools`.

```toml
[plugins]
node = "https://github.com/moonrepo/node-plugin/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/node_plugin.wasm"
```

## Configuration

All plugins can be configured with a `.prototools` file.

- `bundled-npm` (bool) - When `node` is installed, also install `npm` with the version of npm that came bundled with Node.js. Defaults to `false`.
- `dist-url` (string) - The distribution URL to download Node.js archives from. Supports `{version}` and `{file}` tokens.

```toml
[tools.node]
bundled-npm = true
dist-url = "https://..."
```

## Hooks

### Post-install

After Node.js is installed and `bundled-npm` is enabled, the version of npm that came bundled with Node.js will also be installed. This functionality can also be skipped by passing `--no-bundled-npm` during installation.

```shell
proto install node -- --no-bundled-npm
```

## Contributing

Build the plugins:

```shell
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi
```

Test the plugins by running `proto` commands.

```shell
proto install node-test
proto list-remote node-test
```
